        <h2><span>Your Final!</span></h2>
        <p>Your final for this class is to create a personal website. Most of you will be doing a portfolio site, but it can be anything you want. We've been talking about this all semester and finally here is a list of requirements! I originally had you create 5 html, and 1 css files, but then only required you to design 4 pages for week 11's homework so I wanted to clarify what the details were for the final.</p>
        <h3>Due Date</h3>
        <p>April 27th by 5pm EST</p>
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>This project is worth 115pts. 100 of those points are based on meeting the requirements, and 15 of those points are based on whether it's apparent that you put effort and <span class="hover-definition">TLC</span> into the project.

      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>1. Create 6 HTML pages from scratch (remember to include all the necessary meta information and starting tags). You can style this as much as you want to but we'll be focusing on designs in another class. <em>15pts</em></p>
      <p>You should include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 home page</li>
          <li>1 about page</li>
          <li>1 page for all the projects</li>
          <li>3 project pages (or equivalent if you're not doing a portfolio site)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Please include an image on each of these pages.</li>
              <li>Only a title and image is required for now, but you can add as much content in these as you want to. Eventually you'll need to have content in here.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Navigation that can take you to the home and about pages from any of the pages.</li>
          <li>Properly linked links and images with files in appropriate folders.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your files are local to your computer so your URLs will not look pretty, they will be something like <code>file://blahblah/uglyurls/yourname/my-website.........</code>. This is totally fine for this assignment, when grading I'm looking at the folder structure that you've created.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>How should this assignemnt look?</strong> It can be as plain as you want. Please just include something (like an h1 tag with a title) so that I know what page I'm looking at. You can style it and add as much content as you want, since eventually you'll be making this into your final portfolio site project, but it's not required for this week's assignment.</p>
      <p>3. Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-6TSpZDKnLMLII1fQ2WIOQjkACvllR-LTQOJn1FeJAcKRVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this survey</a> (if you haven't already) to help me help you!</p>
