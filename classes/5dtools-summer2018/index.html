        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Let’s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When I’ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit what’s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure it’s written well and won’t screw anything up. This is the feature we’ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>You’ll submit PRs each week and I’ll comment on them until they’re good to go. Once it’s merged, you know it’s correct.</p>
