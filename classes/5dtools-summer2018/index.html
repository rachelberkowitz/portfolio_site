      <p>Throughout the semester we will be working towards creating portfolio sites (or a different personal site).</p>
      <p>Create an HTML file from scratch called <code>index.html</code> (like we did in class), and add the following content:</p>

        <li>Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.</li>

        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Letâ€™s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit whatâ€™s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure itâ€™s written well and wonâ€™t screw anything up. This is the feature weâ€™ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>Youâ€™ll submit PRs each week and Iâ€™ll comment on them until theyâ€™re good to go. Once itâ€™s merged, you know itâ€™s correct.</p>
