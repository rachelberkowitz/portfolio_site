      <h2 class="weekly-title"><span>02</span>HTML Anatomy<date>MAY 14</date></h2>
      <p>How to start an HTML file and project from scratch, view it in the browser, and add basic HTML elements for the start of a website.</p>
      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>Throughout the semester we will be working towards creating portfolio sites (or a different personal site).</p>
      <p>Create an HTML file from scratch called <code>index.html</code> (like we did in class), and add the following content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give your site a title and main heading telling me what type of site it will be. i.e. "Portfolio Site," "My Recipes," "Site About My Favorite Country."</li>
        <li>Write a short description about this website and why you want to make it. Is there anything special about it or things you're aiming to include?</li>
        <li>Your website will need to have at least 3 pages besides the home page. Make a list of what content will be on these three pages. i.e. "Page 1: Art project, Page 2: Game design project" ...etc. Make sure it's formatted correctly for HTML. If you don't know exactly what content will be there, that's okay, just get as specific as you can.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>15pts</em></p>
      <p>Upload your <code>index.html</code> file to this week's folder on GitHub following the same process as last week. The instructions can be found on the repo's main page.</p>

        <h2>What is GitHub and Why are We Using it?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a version control system for code.</p>
        <p>Let’s say me and a friend are working on the same code on different computers. If we both change the same thing, we want to make sure that we pick the right version, and that when I make updates, the other person can get them without copying and pasting a bunch of things.</p>
        <p>When I’ve written some code that I want other people to get, I submit what’s called a Pull Request (PR). Before my code becomes part of the main system, someone checks it to make sure it’s written well and won’t screw anything up. This is the feature we’ll be using for checking homework because it allows me to comment on specific lines of code.</p>
        <p>You’ll submit PRs each week and I’ll comment on them until they’re good to go. Once it’s merged, you know it’s correct.</p>
