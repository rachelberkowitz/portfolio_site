      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <p>This course is an introduction to making websites using HTML and CSS. We will explore the basic concepts, syntax, and application of HTML and CSS and how they work togther.</p>
      <p>This class is the Tools component of 5D Fundamentals: Experience and Drawing ARTG-2223. It aims to provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to execute your goals for projects in that course.</p>
      <p>You should leave the class with a strong understanding of how to create a basic website with HTML and CSS, the syntax and form of these languages, and how to use online resources to learn more.</p>
      <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
      <p>Setting up an HTML page and adding content to it</p>
      <p>Styling said content with CSS</p>
      <p>Setting up a domain name and hosting to get your site live</p>
      <p>How to search online for answers to other questions you might have</p>
      <h2>Expectations</h2>
      <h3>Show up</h3>
      <p>We'll be covering a ton of great information during class. If you have to miss class for any reason, you’re still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments that are due.</p>
      <h3>Stick with it and stay curious</h3>
      <p>Coding can be frustrating, but if you want to learn and you stick with it, it is really rewarding to implement your own designs and know how websites work. Keep at it!</p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>Each homework assignment will be worth 5-15 points. If you come to class, do the assignments and follow instructions, you will pass. If you ask good questions, try to fully learn and understand the content and give a good effort you’ll likely get an A.</p>
        <div class="percentages">
          <h4><span>50%</span> Assignments</h4>
          <h4><span>50%</span> Projects</h4>

      <h2>Class Format + Materials</h2>
      <p>Each week we will have a brief presentation and/or a code demonstration. The goal by the end of the course is to create a personal website (such as a portfolio site), so each week we will be learning snippets of code that lead towards this end goal. If you use all of these snippets, coding your final site will just be putting these pieces together.</p>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <p>The only materials you'll need are a text editor and something to take notes and sketch on. Sublime Text and Atom are popular text editors and are free to download (I use Sublime).</p>
      <p>I one time had $6 left in my bank account when I went to Northeastern. Be twice as good as me me and have at least $12 which is about the amount you’ll need for buying a domain.</p>
      <h2>Handing in Assignments</h2>
      <p>Each week I will post the assignment along with a link to a folder within <a href="https://github.com/vendelal/5d-tools-summer-2018">our GitHub repository for class.</a></p>
      <p>Follow the instructions on the home page for the repo closely to upload your files each week.</p>
      <p>I will leave comments and check your work to make sure you're understanding the concepts from class.</p>
      <h2>Office Hours and Contacting Me</h2>
      <p>I work full time, and some days can get really busy. This means that I might not get to your email until the end of a work day (after 6pm).</p>
      <p>Unfortunately this also means that I will not have office hours :( so if you need help on an assignment, please ask me after class or email me! I'm more than happy to stay late.</p>
      <p>I check my <code>vendelalinnea@mac.com</code> email much more frequently than my Northeastern one, so I recommend reaching me there.</p>
